# Exploring AgenticAI

Welcome to the **Exploring AgenticAI** repository. This project delves into the development and analysis of agent-based artificial intelligence systems, focusing on interactive applications like games to demonstrate agent behaviors and decision-making processes.


## Introduction

Agentic AI refers to systems capable of autonomous decision-making, often modeled as agents that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals. This repository contains implementations of classic games, showcasing how agentic principles can be applied to create intelligent and interactive applications.

## Features

- **Connect Four**: An implementation of the classic Connect Four game, where agents can play against each other or a human player.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: A simulation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, demonstrating basic agent decision-making and strategy.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gupta3681/Exploring_AgenticAI.git
   cd Exploring_AgenticAI
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Connect Four

To play the Connect Four game:

```bash
python connect4_main.py
```
or streamlit run connect4_app.py

### Rock-Paper-Scissors

To simulate the Rock-Paper-Scissors game:

```bash
python rock_paper_scissor_main.py
```
or streamlit run rock_paper_scissor_app.py
